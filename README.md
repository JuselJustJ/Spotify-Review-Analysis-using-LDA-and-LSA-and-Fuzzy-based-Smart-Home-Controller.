# Spotify-Review-Analysis-using-LDA-and-LSA-and-Fuzzy-based-Smart-Home-Controller.
Spotify was among the most popular online music streaming service providers as of March 2022, with millions of monthly users that included paying subscribers. This made Spotify one of the most successful companies in the industry. It features music and podcasts that are spoken in a number of languages and provides something fascinating for everybody who is actively listening to listen to. People will convey their ideas, opinions, and feedbacks about a product or service via the use of active reviews and comments. Some of them aren't hesitant to comment about their experience with this programme by rating it on the Google Play Store Review. Others of them are. Although evaluations are helpful to app developers, artists, and content producers, it might be difficult to classify the assessments and comprehend the requirements of the clients. However, by using topic modelling, we can easily examine the feedback provided by users and enhance their overall experience. The ratings, as well as the comments, from the Spotify app, have been taken into consideration for this project. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Latent Semantic Analysis are the two methods that have been used in the process of carrying out this research. Both of these methods are considered to be latent techniques (LSA). Following the completion of the study, the approach that will prove to be the most successful in light of the current situation will be determined. FLC is the most researched application of fuzzy set theory, fuzzy reasoning, and fuzzy logic. FLC can regulate industrial operations, biomedical devices, and even security. FLC is most successful when used to handle tough, ill-defined challenges by a human operator without previous knowledge of the problem's dynamics. Fuzzy Logic toolbox in MATLAB is essential for creating smart home applications. All disciplines may use it. Using MATLAB's FIS toolbox, we'll create a smart home-appliances system to operate a fire extinguisher, air purifier, water pump, fan, and light. Fire, pollution, soil humidity, and motion sensors are needed to manage these appliances.
